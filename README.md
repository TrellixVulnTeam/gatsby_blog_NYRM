# gatsby_blog


What is this?
This is a new blog where I'll be mergin some of the other projects that I have been
workin on. A little sample of my side projects and a place to showcase what I can do.

What can you do here?
You can give me a feedback of anything I could improve.  If it is about any of the
projects, you probably can find those as a repository in my profile, so feel free to colaborate on those.

I appreciate you come and have a look, hope you like what you see.
